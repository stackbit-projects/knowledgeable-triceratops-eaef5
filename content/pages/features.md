          This is for the most advanced of the advanced web app hackers. Go
          beyond the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to the OWASP Top 20 vulns that
          only the most elite of hackers are finding. We go over topics like:


          *   Next-level reconnaissance and application mapping using both
          manual techniques and CBrown's  tool Snoopy


          *   Cross-Script Sniping


          *   Both Acute and Obtuse Angular JSing


          *   Advanced cryptographic attacks Block Toppling and Bit Flopping


          *   More to come! Will update this list as the course is deciphered
          from the codex.


          All vulnerabilities discussed include practical labs and a final exam
          comprising of a fully-fledged target web application to test your
          skills.
